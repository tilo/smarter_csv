# SmarterCSV 

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tilo/smarter_csv.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tilo/smarter_csv) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/smarter_csv.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/smarter_csv)

`smarter_csv` is a Ruby Gem for smarter importing of CSV Files as Array(s) of Hashes, suitable for direct processing with Mongoid or ActiveRecord,
and parallel processing with Resque or Sidekiq.

One `smarter_csv` user wrote:

  *Best gem for CSV for us yet. [...] taking an import process from 7+ hours to about 3 minutes.
   [...] Smarter CSV was a big part and helped clean up our code ALOT*

`smarter_csv` has lots of features:
 * able to process large CSV-files
 * able to chunk the input from the CSV file to avoid loading the whole CSV file into memory
 * return a Hash for each line of the CSV file, so we can quickly use the results for either creating MongoDB or ActiveRecord entries, or further processing with Resque
 * able to pass a block to the `process` method, so data from the CSV file can be directly processed (e.g. Resque.enqueue )
 * allows to have a bit more flexible input format, where comments are possible, and col_sep,row_sep can be set to any character sequence, including control characters.
 * able to re-map CSV "column names" to Hash-keys of your choice (normalization)
 * able to ignore "columns" in the input (delete columns)
 * able to eliminate nil or empty fields from the result hashes (default)

NOTE; This Gem is only for importing CSV files - writing of CSV files is not supported.

### Why?

Ruby's CSV library's API is pretty old, and it's processing of CSV-files returning Arrays of Arrays feels 'very close to the metal'. The output is not easy to use - especially not if you want to create database records from it. Another shortcoming is that Ruby's CSV library does not have good support for huge CSV-files, e.g. there is no support for 'chunking' and/or parallel processing of the CSV-content (e.g. with Resque or Sidekiq),

As the existing CSV libraries didn't fit my needs, I was writing my own CSV processing - specifically for use in connection with Rails ORMs like Mongoid, MongoMapper or ActiveRecord. In those ORMs you can easily pass a hash with attribute/value pairs to the create() method. The lower-level Mongo driver and Moped also accept larger arrays of such hashes to create a larger amount of records quickly with just one call.

### Examples

The two main choices you have in terms of how to call `SmarterCSV.process` are:
 * calling `process` with or without a block
 * passing a `:chunk_size` to the `process` method, and processing the CSV-file in chunks, rather than in one piece.

Tip: If you are uncertain about what line endings a CSV-file uses, try specifying `:row_sep => :auto` as part of the options. 
But this could be slow, because it will try to analyze each CSV file first. If you want to speed things up, set the `:row_sep` manually! Checkout Example 5 for unusual `:row_sep` and `:col_sep`.

#### Example 1a: How SmarterCSV processes CSV-files as array of hashes:
Please note how each hash contains only the keys for columns with non-null values.

     $ cat pets.csv
     first name,last name,dogs,cats,birds,fish
     Dan,McAllister,2,,,
     Lucy,Laweless,,5,,
     Miles,O'Brian,,,,21
     Nancy,Homes,2,,1,
     $ irb
     > require 'smarter_csv'
      => true
     > pets_by_owner = SmarterCSV.process('/tmp/pets.csv')
      => [ {:first_name=>"Dan", :last_name=>"McAllister", :dogs=>"2"},
           {:first_name=>"Lucy", :last_name=>"Laweless", :cats=>"5"},
           {:first_name=>"Miles", :last_name=>"O'Brian", :fish=>"21"},
           {:first_name=>"Nancy", :last_name=>"Homes", :dogs=>"2", :birds=>"1"}
         ]


#### Example 1b: How SmarterCSV processes CSV-files as chunks, returning arrays of hashes:
Please note how the returned array contains two sub-arrays containing the chunks which were read, each chunk containing 2 hashes.
In case the number of rows is not cleanly divisible by `:chunk_size`, the last chunk contains fewer hashes.

     > pets_by_owner = SmarterCSV.process('/tmp/pets.csv', {:chunk_size => 2, :key_mapping => {:first_name => :first, :last_name => :last}})
       => [ [ {:first=>"Dan", :last=>"McAllister", :dogs=>"2"}, {:first=>"Lucy", :last=>"Laweless", :cats=>"5"} ],
            [ {:first=>"Miles", :last=>"O'Brian", :fish=>"21"}, {:first=>"Nancy", :last=>"Homes", :dogs=>"2", :birds=>"1"} ]
          ]

#### Example 1c: How SmarterCSV processes CSV-files as chunks, and passes arrays of hashes to a given block:
Please note how the given block is passed the data for each chunk as the parameter (array of hashes),
and how the `process` method returns the number of chunks when called with a block

     > total_chunks = SmarterCSV.process('/tmp/pets.csv', {:chunk_size => 2, :key_mapping => {:first_name => :first, :last_name => :last}}) do |chunk|
         chunk.each do |h|   # you can post-process the data from each row to your heart's content, and also create virtual attributes:
           h[:full_name] = [h[:first],h[:last]].join(' ')  # create a virtual attribute
           h.delete(:first) ; h.delete(:last)              # remove two keys
         end
         puts chunk.inspect   # we could at this point pass the chunk to a Resque worker..
       end

       [{:dogs=>"2", :full_name=>"Dan McAllister"}, {:cats=>"5", :full_name=>"Lucy Laweless"}]
       [{:fish=>"21", :full_name=>"Miles O'Brian"}, {:dogs=>"2", :birds=>"1", :full_name=>"Nancy Homes"}]
        => 2

#### Example 2: Reading a CSV-File in one Chunk, returning one Array of Hashes:

    filename = '/tmp/input_file.txt' # TAB delimited file, each row ending with Control-M
    recordsA = SmarterCSV.process(filename, {:col_sep => "\t", :row_sep => "\cM"})  # no block given

    => returns an array of hashes

#### Example 3: Populate a MySQL or MongoDB Database with SmarterCSV:

    # without using chunks:
    filename = '/tmp/some.csv'
    options = {:key_mapping => {:unwanted_row => nil, :old_row_name => :new_name}}
    n = SmarterCSV.process(filename, options) do |array|
          # we're passing a block in, to process each resulting hash / =row (the block takes array of hashes)
          # when chunking is not enabled, there is only one hash in each array
          MyModel.create( array.first )
    end

     => returns number of chunks / rows we processed

#### Example 4: Populate a MongoDB Database in Chunks of 100 records with SmarterCSV:

    # using chunks:
    filename = '/tmp/some.csv'
    options = {:chunk_size => 100, :key_mapping => {:unwanted_row => nil, :old_row_name => :new_name}}
    n = SmarterCSV.process(filename, options) do |chunk|
          # we're passing a block in, to process each resulting hash / row (block takes array of hashes)
          # when chunking is enabled, there are up to :chunk_size hashes in each chunk
          MyModel.collection.insert( chunk )   # insert up to 100 records at a time
    end

     => returns number of chunks we processed


#### Example 5: Reading a CSV-like File, and Processing it with Resque:

    filename = '/tmp/strange_db_dump'   # a file with CRTL-A as col_separator, and with CTRL-B\n as record_separator (hello iTunes!)
    options = {
      :col_sep => "\cA", :row_sep => "\cB\n", :comment_regexp => /^#/,
      :chunk_size => 100 , :key_mapping => {:export_date => nil, :name => :genre}
    }
    n = SmarterCSV.process(filename, options) do |chunk|
        Resque.enque( ResqueWorkerClass, chunk ) # pass chunks of CSV-data to Resque workers for parallel processing
    end
    => returns number of chunks


## Documentation

The `process` method reads and processes a "generalized" CSV file and returns the contents either as an Array of Hashes,
or an Array of Arrays, which contain Hashes, or processes Chunks of Hashes via a given block.

    SmarterCSV.process(filename, options={}, &block)

The options and the block are optional.

`SmarterCSV.process` supports the following options:

     | :verbose                    |   false  | print out line number while processing (to track down problems in input files)       |


#### NOTES about File Encodings:
 * if you have a CSV file which contains unicode characters, you can process it as follows:


       f = File.open(filename, "r:bom|utf-8");
       data = SmarterCSV.process(f);
       f.close


#### NOTES about CSV Headers:
 * as this method parses CSV files, it is assumed that the first line of any file will contain a valid header
 * the first line with the CSV header may or may not be commented out according to the :comment_regexp
 * any occurences of :comment_regexp or :row_sep will be stripped from the first line with the CSV header
 * any of the keys in the header line will be downcased, spaces replaced by underscore, and converted to Ruby symbols before being used as keys in the returned Hashes
 * you can not combine the :user_provided_headers and :key_mapping options
 * if the incorrect number of headers are provided via :user_provided_headers, exception SmarterCSV::HeaderSizeMismatch is raised

#### NOTES on Key Mapping:
 * keys in the header line of the file can be re-mapped to a chosen set of symbols, so the resulting Hashes can be better used internally in your application (e.g. when directly creating MongoDB entries with them)
 * if you want to completely delete a key, then map it to nil or to '', they will be automatically deleted from any result Hash
 * if you have input files with a large number of columns, and you want to ignore all columns which are not specifically mapped with :key_mapping, then use option :remove_unmapped_keys => true

#### NOTES on the use of Chunking and Blocks:
 * chunking can be VERY USEFUL if used in combination with passing a block to File.read_csv FOR LARGE FILES
 * if you pass a block to File.read_csv, that block will be executed and given an Array of Hashes as the parameter.
 * if the chunk_size is not set, then the array will only contain one Hash.
 * if the chunk_size is > 0 , then the array may contain up to chunk_size Hashes.
 * this can be very useful when passing chunked data to a post-processing step, e.g. through Resque

#### NOTES on improper quotation and unwanted characters in headers:
 * some CSV files use un-escaped quotation characters inside fields. This can cause the import to break. To get around this, use the `:force_simple_split => true` option in combination with `:strip_chars_from_headers => /[\-"]/` . This will also significantly speed up the import.
   If you would force a different :quote_char instead (setting it to a non-used character), then the import would be up to 5-times slower than using `:force_simple_split`.

#### Known Issues:
 * if you are using 1.8.7 versions of Ruby, JRuby, or Ruby Enterprise Edition, `smarter_csv` will have problems with double-quoted fields, because of a bug in an underlying library.
