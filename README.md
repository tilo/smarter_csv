  ![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/smarter_csv) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tilo/smarter_csv/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=1L7OD80182)](https://codecov.io/gh/tilo/smarter_csv) [View on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/smarter_csv) [View on RubyToolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/search?q=smarter_csv)

 SmarterCSV provides a convenient interface for reading and writing CSV files and data.

 Unlike traditional CSV parsing methods, SmarterCSV focuses on representing the data for each row as a Ruby hash, which lends itself perfectly for direct use with ActiveRecord, Sidekiq, and JSON stores such as S3. For large files it supports processing CSV data in chunks of array-of-hashes, which allows parallel or batch processing of the data.

 Its powerful interface is designed to simplify and optimize the process of handling CSV data, and allows for highly customizable and efficient data processing by enabling the user to easily map CSV headers to Hash keys, skip unwanted rows, and transform data on-the-fly. 

 This results in a more readable, maintainable, and performant codebase. Whether you're dealing with large datasets or complex data transformations, SmarterCSV streamlines CSV operations, making it an invaluable tool for developers seeking to enhance their data processing workflows.

  When writing CSV data to file, it similarly takes arrays of hashes, and converts them to a CSV file.
