# SmarterCSV 1.x Change Log

## T.B.D.

  * code refactor
  
  * NEW BEHAVIOR:
    - hidden `:v2_mode` options (incomplete!)
    - pre-processing for v2 options
    - implemented v2 `:header_transformations` (DO NOT USE YET!)
      + -> check if all v1 transformations are correctly done
        How are we going to 
        * disambiguate headers?


        * do key_mapping? -> seems to work
          - remove_unmapped_keys  ? 
          - silence missing keys ... a missing mapped key should raise an exception, except when silenced
          - required_keys needs to be a header-validation


        * keep original headers? -> :none
        * do strings_as_* ? -> either :keys_as_symbols, :keys_as_strings
        * remove quote_chars? -> included in keys_as_*
        * strip whitespace? -> included in keys_as_*

        TODO:
        
        - add tests for header_validations
        
        - modify options to handle v1 and v2 options
        - add v1 defaults in v2 processing
        - add tests for all options processing
        - 100% backwards compatibility when working in v1 mode

## 1.10.2 (2024-02-11)
  * improve error message for missing keys

## 1.10.1 (2024-01-07)
  * fix incorrect warning about UTF-8 (issue #268, thanks hirowatari)

## 1.10.0 (2023-12-31) ⚡ BREAKING ⚡

  * BREAKING CHANGES:
    
    Changed behavior:
     + when `user_provided_headers` are provided:
       * if they are not unique, an exception will now be raised
       * they are taken "as is", no header transformations can be applied
       * when they are given as strings or as symbols, it is assumed that this is the desired format
       * the value of the `strings_as_keys` options will be ignored
         
     + option `duplicate_header_suffix` now defaults to `''` instead of `nil`.
       * this allows automatic disambiguation when processing of CSV files with duplicate headers, by appending a number
       * explicitly set this option to `nil` to get the behavior from previous versions.

  * performance and memory improvements
  * code refactor

## 1.9.3 (2023-12-16)
  * raise SmarterCSV::IncorrectOption when `user_provided_headers` are empty
  * code refactor / no functional changes
  * added test cases

## 1.9.2 (2023-11-12)
  * fixed bug with '\\' at end of line (issue #252, thanks to averycrespi-moz)
  * fixed require statements (issue #249, thanks to PikachuEXE, courtsimas)
    
## 1.9.1 (2023-10-30) (YANKED)
  * yanked
  * no functional changes
  * refactored directory structure
  * re-added JRuby and TruffleRuby to CI tests
  * no C-accelleration for JRuby
  * refactored options parsing
  * code coverage / rubocop

## 1.9.0 (2023-09-04)
  * fixed issue #139

  * Error `SmarterCSV::MissingHeaders` was renamed to `SmarterCSV::MissingKeys`
    
  * CHANGED BEHAVIOR:
    When `key_mapping` option is used. (issue #139)
    Previous versions just printed an error message when a CSV header was missing during key mapping.
    Versions >= 1.9 will throw `SmarterCSV::MissingHeaders` listing all headers that were missing during mapping.

  * Notable details for `key_mapping` and `required_headers`:

    * `key_mapping` is applied to the headers early on during `SmarterCSV.process`, and raises an error if a header in the input CSV file is missing, and we can not map that header to its desired name.

    Mapping errors can be surpressed by using:
    * `silence_missing_keys` set to `true`, which silence all such errors, making all headers for mapping optional.
    * `silence_missing_keys` given an Array with the specific header keys that are optional
    The use case is that some header fields are optional, but we still want them renamed if they are present.

    * `required_headers` checks which headers are present **after** `key_mapping` was applied.

## 1.8.5 (2023-06-25)
  * fix parsing of escaped quote characters (thanks to JP Camara)
    
## 1.8.4 (2023-04-01)
  * fix gem loading issue (issue #232, #234)
  
## 1.8.3 (2023-03-30)
  * bugfix: windows one-column files were raising NoColSepDetected (issue #229)
    

## 1.8.2 (2023-03-21)
  * bugfix: do not raise `NoColSepDetected` for CSV files with only one column in most cases (issue #222)
            If the first lines contain non-ASCII characters, and no col_sep is detected, it will still raise `NoColSepDetected`

## 1.8.1 (2023-03-19)
  * added validation against invalid values for :col_sep, :row_sep, :quote_char (issue #216)
  * deprecating `required_headers` and replace with `required_keys` (issue #140)
  * fixed issue with require statement

## 1.8.0 (2023-03-18) BREAKING
  * NEW DEFAULTS: `col_sep: :auto`, `row_sep: :auto`. Fully automatic detection by default.
    
    MAKE SURE to rescue `NoColSepDetected` if your CSV files can have unexpected formats, 
              e.g. from users uploading them to a service, and handle those cases.

  * ignore Byte Order Marker (BOM) in first line in file (issues #27, #219)

## 1.7.4 (2023-01-13)
  * improved guessing of the column separator, thanks to Alessandro Fazzi

## 1.7.3 (2022-12-05)
  * new option :silence_missing_keys; if set to true, it ignores missing keys in `key_mapping`

## 1.7.2 (2022-08-29)
  * new option :with_line_numbers; if set to true, it adds :csv_line_number to each data hash (issue #130)
  
## 1.7.1 (2022-07-31)
  * bugfix for issue #195 #197 #200 which only appeared when called from Rails (thanks to Viacheslav Markin, Nicolas Rodriguez)

## 1.7.0 (2022-06-26) (replaced by 1.7.1)
  * added native code to accellerate line parsing by >10x over 1.6.0
  * added option `acceleration`, defaulting to `true`, to enable native code.
    Disable this option to use the ruby code for line parsing.
  * increased test coverage to 100%
  * rubocop changes

## 1.7.0.pre5 (2022-06-20)
  * fixed compiling
  * rubocop changes
  * published pre-release 

## 1.7.0.pre1 (2022-05-23)
  * added native code to accellerate line parsing by >10x over 1.6.0
  * added option `acceleration`, defaulting to `true`, to enable native code.
    Disable this option to use the ruby code for line parsing.
  * increased test coverage to 100%

## 1.6.1 (2022-05-06)
  * unused keys in `key_mapping` now generate a warning, no longer raise an exception
    This is preferable when `key_mapping` is done defensively for variabilities in the CSV files.

## 1.6.0 (2022-05-03)
  * completely rewrote line parser
  * added methods `SmarterCSV.raw_headers` and `SmarterCSV.headers` to allow easy examination of how the headers are processed.

## 1.5.2 (2022-04-29)
  * added missing keys to the SmarterCSV::KeyMappingError exception message #189 (thanks to John Dell)
  
## 1.5.1 (2022-04-27)
  * added raising of `KeyMappingError` if `key_mapping` refers to a non-existent key
  * added option `duplicate_header_suffix` (thanks to Skye Shaw)
    When given a non-nil string, it uses the suffix to append numbering 2..n to duplicate headers.
    If your code will need to process arbitrary CSV files, please set `duplicate_header_suffix`.

## 1.5.0 (2022-04-25)
  * fixed bug with trailing col_sep characters, introduced in 1.4.0
  * Fix deprecation warning in Ruby 3.0.3 / $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR (thanks to Joel Fouse )

  * changed default for `comment_regexp` to be `nil` for a safer default behavior (thanks to David Lazar)
  **Note**
    This no longer assumes that lines starting with `#` are comments.
    If you want to treat lines starting with '#' as comments, use `comment_regexp: /\A#/`

## 1.4.2 (2022-02-12)
  * fixed issue with simplecov

## 1.4.1 (2022-02-12) (PULLED)

  * added simplecov

## 1.4.0 (2022-02-11)
  * dropped GPL license, smarter_csv is now only using the MIT License
  * added experimental option `col_sep: 'auto` to auto-detect the column separator (issue #183)
    The default behavior is still to assume `,` is the column separator. 
  * fixed buggy behavior when using `remove_empty_values: false` (issue #168)
  * fixed Ruby 3.0 deprecation

## 1.3.0 (2022-02-06) Breaking code change if you used `--key_mappings`
 * fix bug for key_mappings (issue #181)   
   The values of the `key_mappings` hash will now be used "as is", and no longer forced to be symbols

   **Users with existing code with `--key_mappings` need to change their code** to 
     * either use symbols in the `key_mapping` hash
     * or change the expected keys from symbols to strings

## 1.2.9 (2021-11-22) (PULLED)
 * fix bug for key_mappings (issue #181)
   The values of the `key_mappings` hash will now be used "as is", and no longer forced to be symbols

 * fixing UTF-8 related bug which was introduced in 1.1.2 (thanks to Tirdad C.)

## 1.1.3 (2016-12-30)
